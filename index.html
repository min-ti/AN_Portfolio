hey wt u thik of this resume and any advice ?
ChatGPT said:
Your resume is well-structured and presents a strong hybrid profile in Energy Management and Software QA. That said, here’s a breakdown of what’s working well and what can be improved, followed by specific suggestions:

✅ What’s Working Well:
Clear Summary: The headline and summary communicate your dual expertise effectively.

Quantified Achievements: Your use of metrics (e.g., “reduced wait times by 20%”) adds credibility and impact.

Project Highlights: Both energy and QA projects show real-world application of your skills.

Concise Format: One page is ideal, and you’ve used the space efficiently.

⚠️ What Can Be Improved:
1. Contact Section
Add your LinkedIn and GitHub (you previously mentioned them: LinkedIn - akhilesh-narotra-30b567290 and GitHub - min-ti). It boosts credibility instantly.

2. Profile/Summary
The first line is a bit too buzzword-heavy and generic. Make it more personal and goal-oriented, e.g.:

“Recent graduate with dual specialization in Energy Management and Software QA, passionate about optimizing systems for sustainability and performance. Experienced in RETScreen, automation tools, and stakeholder collaboration.”

3. Skills Section
Consider categorizing more clearly:

▪ Technical Tools: Power BI, Selenium, Figma, VirtualBox  
▪ Energy & Sustainability: RETScreen, GHG Reporting, Energy Audits  
▪ Software & QA: Automation Testing, JIRA, Manual/Regression Testing  
▪ Soft Skills: Leadership, Stakeholder Engagement, Operational Planning
4. Professional Experience
Reverse the order to start with your latest job.

Add location (Waterloo) and months for "Studental Care Rep" to match formatting.

Use bold for job titles and organization names for readability.

5. Key Projects
Label this section as “Projects” and move it above education—it shows your practical skills.

For each project, include tools used and impact, just like you did. Very strong already!

6. Education Section
Fix spacing in “Bachelor of Computer Application| Guru Nanak Dev University”

Add expected graduation months if applying in mid-2025.

✍🏽 Suggested Rewrite of Summary:
Hybrid Technologist | Energy Management & QA Automation
Detail-oriented graduate with hands-on experience in energy audits, RETScreen analysis, and QA automation. Proven ability to reduce operational waste, automate test cases, and enhance stakeholder satisfaction. Passionate about sustainability and smart systems that improve performance and reduce costs.

Final Tips:
Save and export as Akhilesh_Narotra_Resume_2025.pdf

Always tailor the profile and skills to the job description when applying.

Want me to turn this into a job-specific version (e.g. for QA Analyst or Energy Coordinator)?

Yes, I remember! You were working on your GitHub portfolio. How’s it coming along? Do you need help with any specific project or formatting for your GitHub? Feel free to share what you’ve got so far, and I can help you improve or polish it.

alright lets do it from wehrer we left , u gave me this file , i have done anything wiht it 
ChatGPT said:
Great — thanks for sharing the files again. Here's where you left off:

✅ You have a clean and responsive one-page portfolio with these sections:

Header with your name and role

About Me

Projects (3 are listed)

Skills (nicely tagged)

Resume download link

Contact form

Footer with GitHub and LinkedIn

🔧 NEXT STEPS / IMPROVEMENTS
Here’s what we can work on next to level it up:

1. Add a Profile Picture (Optional but impactful)
Put an image of yourself in the top header or about section.

You can upload it as profile.jpg and insert this:

<img src="profile.jpg" alt="Akhilesh Narotra" class="profile-pic" />
Add in style.css:

.profile-pic {
  width: 120px;
  height: 120px;
  border-radius: 50%;
  object-fit: cover;
  margin-top: 10px;
}
2. Add More Project Cards with GitHub Links
Example:

<div class="project">
  <h3>WordPress Site Audit</h3>
  <p>Performed security and performance audit on a WordPress-based site using Kali Linux tools and optimization plugins.</p>
  <a href="https://github.com/min-ti/wordpress-audit" target="_blank">View on GitHub</a>
</div>
Let me know if you'd like help writing 1-2 new project descriptions based on your experience (e.g., QA, RETScreen, Linux, etc.).

3. Add Animations/Transitions
You’re already using AOS — nice!
You could enhance the look by adding hover effects to buttons:

.button:hover {
  background-color: #0056b3;
  color: white;
  transition: all 0.3s ease;
}
4. Improve Mobile Experience
Check on your phone. If layout breaks, we can tweak media queries to make everything responsive (especially projects and skills section).

5. Deploy It Online
You can host this portfolio:

🔹 On GitHub Pages (free + easy)

🔹 Or use Netlify or Vercel

I can walk you through the GitHub Pages deployment right now if you’re ready.

🚀 Let’s Start With…
 Do you want help writing 1–2 more project cards?

 Want to deploy it online?

 Want to add a profile picture or polish the “About Me” section?

Let me know where you want to begin.

Perfect — here’s a breakdown of next steps based on your new resume and goals for the GitHub-hosted portfolio site:

✅ GOAL SUMMARY
🔗 Add working LinkedIn and Resume Download links

🎨 Update the portfolio’s content to match your new resume

💡 Optional: Add your new project (UX Redesign – Student Portal)

✅ 1. Fix LinkedIn & Resume Link
In your index.html:

🔧 LinkedIn:
Already present in the footer but can be added to the top nav if needed.

Footer section:

<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/akhilesh-narotra-30b567290/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>
🔧 Resume:
Upload your new resume as Akhilesh_Narotra_Resume.pdf (rename exactly to match the HTML).

Then in this section:

<a class="button" href="Akhilesh_Narotra_Resume.pdf" download>Download Resume (PDF)</a>
✅ Just make sure to overwrite the old resume file in your GitHub repo with the updated one.

✅ 2. Update Text Content to Match New Resume
🔄 Header
Update tagline:

<p>Technical Support • QA Analyst • Web Systems</p>
🔄 About Me Section:
Replace with this:

<p>Recent graduate with expertise in software quality assurance and technical support. Known for bridging the gap between user needs and system issues, delivering reliable and user-friendly web solutions. Passionate about testing, troubleshooting, and continuous improvement.</p>
✅ 3. Update Projects Section
Replace “Isla Mocha” and “Energy Audit” if focusing more on QA/Tech. Suggested new section:

<section id="projects" data-aos="fade-up">
  <h2>Projects</h2>
  <div class="project">
    <h3>Web Banking QA</h3>
    <p>Executed 50+ test cases, validated backend data with SQL, and tracked 40+ bugs in JIRA for a simulated banking app.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="project">
    <h3>Student Portal UX Redesign</h3>
    <p>Redesigned portal layout and accessibility using Figma, improving usability and WCAG compliance.</p>
  </div>
</section>
You can keep the Energy project if you want to highlight your versatility, or remove it for focus.

# Step 3: Push the changes to GitHub
git add .
git commit -m "Updated index and resume for portfolio site"

wb this one 
ChatGPT said:
Great question — here’s what that step does and when to use it:

✅ What That Git Command Does:
git add .
➡️ Adds all your changed files (like your new index.html and Akhilesh_Narotra_Resume.pdf) to the staging area.

git commit -m "Updated index and resume for portfolio site"
➡️ Creates a commit with a message describing your changes.

git push
➡️ Sends your local changes to GitHub.com, updating your live portfolio.

🟢 When to Use It
You run these ONLY IF:

You're making changes on your computer (not using GitHub's website interface).

You’ve already cloned the GitHub repo and you're working in the repo folder.

❓ Did You Already Upload Using GitHub Website?
If yes, you don’t need to run these commands — you’ve already pushed your changes through the website ✅.

🧠 TL;DR:
✅ Using GitHub website? — You’re already done!

💻 Using terminal on your PC? — Then run the git add, commit, and push.

Need help doing the terminal method? Just tell me your setup (Windows/Mac and folder path), and I’ll walk you through.

Perfect. Let’s tackle everything in one go. Here's what I’m doing for you:

✅ 1. LinkedIn Link (Open in New Tab, for Visitors)
Your current footer is good. But if you want to add the LinkedIn icon or a clearer “Visit My LinkedIn” above the footer (or in About), we can add this:

Example:
<p>
  <a class="button" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/akhilesh-narotra-30b567290/" target="_blank">
    View My LinkedIn Profile
  </a>
</p>
You can place that in the About Me section or even in the header under your name.

Footer: LinkedIn is now clearly placed alongside GitHub and Email for better visibility.

🧭 Next Step:
I’ll now generate the projects.html page to hold your full project showcase in a cleaner, focused layout.

Tabs for QA / UX / Energy?

Let me know your favorite look! Or I’ll default to a clean responsive grid with light animations.

ChatGPT said:
Love that direction — here’s what would look cool, techy, and personal while keeping it professional:

🔮 Recommended Design: Pixel-Tech Card Grid with Animated Effects
Think: Dark-themed project grid, subtle glowing borders, and hover animations (like neon effects or pixel flicker), with each project card revealing detailed info on click or hover.

🔧 What It’ll Include:
Dark mode layout (deep gray/black background)

Neon-style animated borders or glowing hover effects (cyberpunk-ish)

Subtle “pixel” or scan-line background animation (like CRT monitor feel)

Tech icons for project types (💻, ⚡️, 🎨)

Responsive grid for desktop + mobile

🧱 Layout:
-----------------------------------
|  Web Banking QA    |  Student Portal UI |
|  [💻 Tech Tag]      |  [🎨 UX Tag]        |
-----------------------------------
|  Wellness App      |  Energy Audit      |
|  [🧘‍♂️ Design]      |  [⚡️ Energy]        |
-----------------------------------
Click or hover will show:

Detailed description

Tools used (icons or tags)

Optional: GitHub link, PDF preview, Figma image, etc.

👾 Bonus Touches (for personality):
Background pixel particles or “matrix-style” animated background

Glitch animation on your name/logo

Typewriter or code-loader intro animation on the projects page

✅ Let’s Build It
I'll start with:

Creating projects.html with this grid layout

Styling it with a cool tech-themed

      <p>Hello! I'm Akhilesh — a curious, detail-driven tech enthusiast passionate about solving problems and creating meaningful digital experiences. With a background in both energy management and software testing, I thrive at the intersection of technology, sustainability, and usability. I love turning complex challenges into simple, human-centered solutions — whether it's debugging a web app or designing a cleaner interface. When I'm not working with code or RETScreen models, you'll find me exploring art, spirituality, and cooking something experimental in the kitchen. My goal? To keep learning, growing, and making things that matter.</p>
